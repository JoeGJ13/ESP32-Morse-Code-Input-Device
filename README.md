# Dot-Dasher by Mosby BoysüéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Mosby Boys


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Joe George James - [STGITS]
- Member 2: Aaron Binoy - STGITS

### Project Description
A input device that uses Morse code for inputting. The device recieves input in morse code and converts it into respective English characters and numbers
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Normal typing using keyboard is boring and quick (like guns[Dark knight reference]) where Morse code is fun and slow 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Using an ESP32's capacitive touch, we programmed a pin to recieve input in morse code. It makes data inputting fun and engaging and realize how much struggle our ancestors had to go through for sending a message

## Technical Details
